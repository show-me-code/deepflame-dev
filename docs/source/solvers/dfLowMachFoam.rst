One-Dimensional Planar Flame
----------------------------------------


**Problem Description**


The case simulates the steady-state 1D freely-propagating flame. The results are able to catch the flame thickness, laminar fame speed and the detailed 1D flame structure. This case demonstrate that the convection-diffusion-reaction algorithms implemented in our solver are stable and accurate.
