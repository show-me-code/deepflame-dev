CVODE Intergrator
===================
CVODE Integrator is the one without the application of Deep Neural Network (DNN), and it can be used to validate PyTorch and LibTorch integrators.
Follow the steps below to run an example of CVODE. Examples are stored in the directory: 
.. code-block:: bash

    $HOME/deepflame-dev/examples

To run these examples, first source your OpenFOAM, depending on your OpenFOAM path:

.. code-block:: bash

    source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7/etc/bashrc

Then, source your DeepFlame:

.. code-block:: bash

    source $HOME/deepflame-dev/bashrc

Next, you can go to the directory of any example case that you want to run. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $HOME/deepflame-dev/examples/zeroD_cubicReactor/H2/cvodeIntegrator

This is an example for the zero-dimensional hydrogen combustion  with CVODE integrator.

The case is run by simply typing: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./Allrun

The probe used for post processing is defined in ``/system/probes``. In this case, the probe is located at the coordinates (0.0025 0.0025 0.0025) to measure temperature variation with time. 
If the case is successfully run, the result can be found in ``/postProcessing/probes/0/T``, and it can be visualized by running: 

.. code-block:: bash

    gunplot
    plot "/your/path/to/postProcessing/probes/0/T"

You will get a graph:
