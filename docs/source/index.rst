=======================================
Welcome to DeepFlame's Documentation
=======================================

.. _Overview:

DeepFlame is a computational fluid dynamics suite for single or multiphase, laminar or turbulent reacting flows at all speeds with machine learning capabilities. It aims to provide an open-source 
platform bringing together the individual strengths of `OpenFOAM <https://openfoam.org/>`_, `Cantera <https://cantera.org/>`_ and `Torch <https://pytorch.org/libraries>`_ libraries
for deep learning assisted reacting flow simulations. It is also has the scope to incorporate next-generation heterogenous supercomputing and AI acceleration infrustructures such as GPU and FPGAs.

.. Note:: This project is under active development.
